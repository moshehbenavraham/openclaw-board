# PRD Phase 03: Residual Risk Cleanup and Closeout

**Status**: In Progress
**Sessions**: 3
**Estimated Duration**: 3-5 days

**Progress**: 1/3 sessions (33%)

---

## Overview

Phase 03 closes the remaining hardening debt left after the foundational, route, and read-path remediation work. The phase focuses on the last low-severity runtime and client cleanup items, then ends with verification evidence and synchronized security documentation so the PRD can be closed intentionally.

## Progress Tracker

| Session | Name | Status | Est. Tasks | Validated |
|---------|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| 01 | State, cache, and environment hardening | Complete | ~12-18 | PASS |
| 02 | Client and operational cleanup | Not Started | ~12-18 | - |
| 03 | Verification and closeout | Not Started | ~15-20 | - |

## Completed Sessions

- `phase03-session01-state-cache-and-environment-hardening`

---

## Upcoming Sessions

- Session 02: Client and operational cleanup

---

## Objectives

1. Eliminate remaining low-severity security debt and convenience fallbacks that can undermine the hardened model.
2. Tighten browser-side and operational behavior so local usage stays predictable and bounded.
3. Finish with verification evidence and synchronized security documentation.

---

## Prerequisites

- Phase 02 completed
- Shared auth, path, bridge, and read-path helpers remain the default implementation path
- Carryforward and security posture notes reviewed before session planning

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture

Continue routing runtime, cache, and read-path changes through shared helpers instead of route-local fixes. Final cleanup should preserve the current Cloudflare Access plus operator-code model rather than introducing a new auth boundary during closeout.

### Technologies

- Next.js App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Local OpenClaw bridge and filesystem helpers

### Risks

- Residual runtime hazards may reappear if closeout fixes bypass the shared helper pattern. Mitigation: keep Phase 03 changes centralized in the existing helper modules where possible.
- Client cleanup can destabilize operator workflows if polling, storage, or confirmations change without clear operator messaging. Mitigation: keep failure states explicit and bounded.
- Final verification may uncover stale findings or docs late in the phase. Mitigation: reserve Session 03 for evidence gathering and documentation reconciliation.

### Relevant Considerations

- [P03] **Atomic alert config writes**: Session 01 should replace partial-write behavior with crash-safe persistence.
- [P03] **Mutable config cache**: Session 01 should return safe cache copies or otherwise prevent caller mutation.
- [P03] **Environment path overrides need a hard boundary**: Session 01 should keep env-driven filesystem access inside approved roots.
- [P03] **Browser storage needs retention limits**: Session 02 should add pruning, expiry, or bounded retention for client state.
- [P03] **Security headers are still incomplete**: Session 02 should finish the remaining header tightening work that fits the closeout scope.
- [P03] **Read-heavy routes must keep bounded budgets**: Any Phase 03 read-path touch should reuse the shared async helper and avoid reintroducing sync scans.

## Success Criteria

Phase complete when:

- [ ] All 3 sessions completed
- [ ] Remaining runtime and client cleanup findings are fixed or explicitly dispositioned
- [ ] Final validation evidence exists for the hardened surfaces
- [ ] Security documentation and findings registers match the implemented state

## Dependencies

### Depends On

- Phase 02: Runtime Boundary and Read Path Hardening

### Enables

- Project closeout and steady-state maintenance after the PRD backlog is complete
