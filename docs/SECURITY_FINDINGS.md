# OpenClaw Dashboard Security Findings Register

## Status Values

- `Open`: confirmed and not yet fixed
- `In Progress`: implementation started but not yet verified
- `Fixed`: code or docs changed, awaiting verification
- `Verified`: fix validated
- `Accepted`: risk intentionally accepted with rationale
- `Deferred`: planned for later work

## Canonical Scope

Canonical finding definitions and delivery mapping live in `.spec_system/PRD/PRD.md`, Appendix A and Appendix B. This file tracks status only.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this register in sync with the latest PRD-backed understanding of the repo.
- When a finding changes status, add a short note or link in the related PR or spec session.
- Do not mark a finding `Verified` until the validation evidence exists.
- If a finding is split into smaller tasks, keep the parent SYN ID visible so the audit lineage is not lost.
